## How to use

Go to the releases section and download DeskCut's latest version, Install and that's it!

1. You can download either the `.deb` version or the `AppImage`.   
2. Use the `.deb` file to directly install it using your store app.   
3. AppImage is portable and it doesn't integrate by default.   
You'll have to run the file everytime you want to use the app so make sure you use something like AppImage launcher to properly install it on your system.
